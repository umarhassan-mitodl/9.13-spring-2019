**Note:** Lecture 2 should help but hopefully not be required for this assignment.

**Article:** Tootell, R.B.H., J.B. Reppas, et al. "[Visual Motion Aftereffect in Human Cortical Area MT Revealed by Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging](https://www.nature.com/articles/375139a0)." _Nature_ 375 (1995): 139–41.  DOI: 10.1038/375139a0

**Assignment:** Read the assigned article carefully (expect to spend at least one hour on this, possibly more) and think about it, then provide short answers to the questions below.

1.  What is the characteristic functional (response) property of cortical area MT (V5)? Answer in a phrase or sentence.
2.  Which aspect of Figure 2 shows the central new finding of the paper?
3.  Does activity in cortical area MT reflect what the subject is perceiving, or what visual information is arriving on the retina? Answer and explain in at most 3 clear sentences.
